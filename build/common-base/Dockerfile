# Published image: civicrm/civicrm-base
#
# This is a base image that serves as a foundation for other CiviCRM images. It
# includes all the core dependencies required to run CiviCRM but does not
# include CMS or Standalone specific dependencies.
#
# It is based on the official Docker php on apache images. It used the Debian
# variant and hardcodes a Debian version.
#
# There is no fpm variant at the moment though we may support that in the
# future. Please submit an issue if you want to support this effort.
#
# Images are generated for all supported minor releases of PHP that are
# recommended by CiviCRM.
